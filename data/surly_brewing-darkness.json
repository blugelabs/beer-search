Problem is that you want to sip it all night. Look for this one to be released when the leaves change color and Halloween is approaching. Brewed with a blend of 8 different malts, oats and candi sugar. This huge stout reflects Surly's commitment to brewing intensely flavored beers in small batches. Only 25 barrels of this beer were brewed.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
