In other words, there is no true category for this beer... Characterized by its distinctive Mount Hood hop aroma and beautiful blonde color, Liquid Sunshine™ is brewed at a low temperature to create a nice light dry finish. Using only the finest 2-row malted barley, wheat, rye, and great northwestern grown hops, this combination results in a clean, crisp, and uniquely refreshing beer. As usual, no artificial preservatives have been added to our beer during and/or after the brewing process...\r\nThere’s nothing like it under the sun!!!","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
