Specially crafted to inspire you and your thirstiest mates barstool conversations. Light copper in colour. This pint is quite malty with just enough East Kent hops for a nice, earthy hoppiness. Naturally cask conditioned, this may be served a little cold for a true Brit but is a \r\ncomplimentary double nod to one of the 1st beer styles. Cheers mate!","style":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","category":"British Ale"}
