One of the original three packaged beers, it is still available year-round, but only at our pub.  Coppery in color and robust in flavor, Bachelor Bitter will leave your taste buds humming. Galena, Willamette and Kent Golding hops create fantastic hop bitterness, aroma and flavor.\r\n\r\nBachelor Bitter also kicked off the Bond Street Series that launched in April 2005.  The Bond Street Series is a specialty line of beers available in 22-ounce bottles.","style":"Ordinary Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
