Effervescent and crisp, this seriously delicious elixir tempts the palate with apple (oh so Garden of Eden), pear and a little earthy mustiness. Fallen Angel captivates your senses with its lightness and brightness while its 8% ABV strength breathes fire into your soul, warming you from the inside out. \r\n\r\nAngel-like in appearance, the devil is in its strength. \r\n\r\nWith its introduction in 2006 and its immediate cult following, Fallen Angel is now brewed and released about once a year.","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
