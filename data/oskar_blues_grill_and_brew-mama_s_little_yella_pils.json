{"name":"Mama's Little Yella Pils","abv":5.3,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"oskar_blues_grill_and_brew","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Mama’s Little Yella Pils - Our upcoming new canned good is a small-batch version of the beer that made Pilsen, Czechoslovakia famous. Mama’s is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and a blend of traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. Our first canned lager, it’s also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast.\r\n\r\nThis tasteful reality Czech is the perfect antidote for the watered-down versions of pilsner clogging America’s shelves. And Mama’s gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) mean we’re finally honoring consumer requests for a delicious but less-challenging beer. (Hey, we like a good low-dose session beer, too.) Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March.\r\n\r\nSadly, the Feds rejected our “Take Two and Call Us in the Morning” line on the can.","style":"German-Style Pilsener","category":"German Lager"}
