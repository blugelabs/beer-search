(I'll list that one as one of the Blind Bat beers when I'm happy with the test batches and am ready to offer it to the public.) I didn't find anything about smoked wit beers, but decided to experiment a bit (a wit is a wheat beer). I like it, and hope you will too. \r\n\r\nPictured on the label is Long Island's old Walt Whitman, enjoying a smoke and a book in what is purported to be his favorite spot in his native West Hills. Long Island's springtime is awakening all around him.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
