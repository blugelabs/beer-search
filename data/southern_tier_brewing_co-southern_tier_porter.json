{"name":"Southern Tier Porter","abv":5.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"southern_tier_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Porter is our darkest beer, but not necessarily our strongest.  It is widely held that the darker the beer, the stronger the beer, but this is a summarily false.  The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.  Some malt is oasted to achieve dark color and coffee-like flavor which in turn get transferred to the beer.\r\n\r\nOur Porter is ruchly complex with overtones of chocolate and expresso beans followed by a subtle flavor of hops.  It's a nourishing beer without being too sweet or filling.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
