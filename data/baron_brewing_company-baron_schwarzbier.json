At first the Schwarzbier starts with a slight roasty nose and taste, followed by a faint chocolate-malty body with a very crisp, clean, lagered finish. Lagered for an average of 10-12 weeks to provide a very smooth, easy drinking Schwarzbier with full flavor provided by the dark malts. \r\n\r\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.","style":"German-Style Schwarzbier","category":"German Lager"}
