The beer is pale amber in color but light in body. A gentle hop bitterness compliments its complex malt character. \n\nFinnegans is currently available on tap and in liquor stores throughout the state of Minnesota. Finnegans is unique in that 100% of the profits are donated to The Finnegans Community Fund which disburses grants to help the working poor and at-risk youth throughout Minnesota.
