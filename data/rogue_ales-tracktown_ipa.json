Hops, Hops, Hops from front to back but nicely offset with a malty richness that prevents this ale from being overbearing. Tracktown is made from 100% Floor Malted Maris Otter, 100% Northwest Amarillo Hops, Free Range Coastal Water, and absolutely No Chemicals, Additives, or Preservatives.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
