These hops provide a special floral aroma and a delightfully hoppy finish.\r\nPeregrine Falcons were recently reintroduced to the Harrisburg area as well as other large cities in Pennsylvania. This Falcon is one of the fastest birds, reaching speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour. Its unique ability to rid urban areas of its nemesis, the pigeon, has cities throughout the region clamoring for the Peregrine as a permanent resident.","style":"German-Style Pilsener","category":"German Lager"}
