The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs. Ten different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed. \r\n\r\nEven with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey. Produced for the holidays, 10 102 Anniversary Ale is usually available into late spring.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
