It was opened in May of 1989 by Andy Pherson, who now serves both as the company's president and brewmaster. The company's first brewery was located in the basement of the Bridgewater Woolen Mill in Vermont's Green Mountains, but by 1995 the company had become popular enough that it was able to relocate to a state-of-the-art brewery and visitor center (featuring an open-air deck overlooking the Ottaquechee River) in Bridgewater Corners, VT.","address":["Route 4 & 100A"],"geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lat":43.5882,"lon":-72.6563}}
