{"name":"Bourbon County Stout","abv":13.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"goose_island_beer_company_clybourn","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Brewed in honor of the 1000th batch at our original Clybourn brewpub. A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with thick foam the color of a bourbon barrel. The nose is an intense mix of charred oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and smoke. One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer. A great cigar beer.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
