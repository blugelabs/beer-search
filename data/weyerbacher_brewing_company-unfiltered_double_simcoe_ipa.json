Expect Cask taste in a bottle, with more pronounced hoppy flavor and aroma due to being unfiltered. Also, carbonation will be a bit higher as is usual in our cork n cage series in keeping with tradition. It all comes together to form a uniquely great experience for hopheads.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
