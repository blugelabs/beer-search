{"name":"Muse Farmhouse Ale","abv":6.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"weyerbacher_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Muse, a Farmhouse Ale,  is brewed \"somewhat\" in the tradition of the style, but it has Weyerbacher fingerprints all over it! Made with Pale malt, a little carapils, raw wheat and raw oats, this warm weather seasonal is dry and ever so slightly tart on the pallet from the wheat and oats. At 6.2% abv, its a bit higher than your strictly traditional farmhouse, but not out of the realm, really. The wheat and oats makes the mouthfeel silky and light at the same time.  They also bring some cloudiness to the brew, but don't be afraid!  Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher, something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be, served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative.\r\nFermented with Forbidden Fruit yeast, at a very high temperature (78F), the spiciness developed is entirely from this traditional yeast strain, not from any kettle additions. Unfiltered, to enjoy this natural beauty, and imagine yourself out in the flat fields of Belgium! Cheers!","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
