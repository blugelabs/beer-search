Blanche, meaning \"white\", takes its name from the whitish haze in this pale gold brew, which is a result of the raw wheat and wheat malts used to brew this Belgian-style beer. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Blanche was named as Best of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast in the Belgian Specialty category at the US Beer Tasting Championships.\r\n\r\nWhite beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.  Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.\r\n\r\nBlanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.  In the mouth you'll find a mild and refreshing ale with a hint of dryness from the wheat ingredients.  A clean finish follows with just a hint of tart spiciness.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
