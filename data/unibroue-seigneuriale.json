It is slightly\r\nsweet, malty and spicy, but a distinctive hop\r\ncharacter and notes of apricot brandy give\r\nSeigneuriale a truly unique character. \r\n\r\nWe recommending pairing it with carved ham,\r\napricot-glazed duck or squab, Thai shrimp\r\ncurry or a holiday fruit cake.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
