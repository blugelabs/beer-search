{"name":"XS Imperial Stout","abv":10.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"rogue_ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Deserving the title \"Emperor of Ales\" (unlike the bourgeois \"King of Beers\"), Imperial is the strongest and fullest of all stouts. Imperials originally were brewed with large quantities of hops and a high alcohol content to withstand long, unrefrigerated journeys. Rogue Imperial Stout, considered the high end of stouts, is made of 2-row Great Western Harrington & Klages, Hugh Baird XLT-80, Black, Munich and Chocolate Malts; Willamette, Cascade and Chinook hops; rolled oats; and two secret ingredients. Unfiltered and unfined, Imperial Stout is best when aged for one year. Imperial Stout is available in a new 750-ml ceramic swing-top bottle (replacing the much older 7-ounce and more recent 12-ounce XS-line packaging) and on draft.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
