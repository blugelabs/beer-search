In cask, this beer has twice won CAMRAâ€™s Champion Beer of Scotland.\r\nOn the nose, this dark beer offers bitter chocolate, figs, toffee and hints of fruit.\r\n\r\nOn the palate, this resolves into beautiful, silky-smooth, coffee-and-chocolate flavours, followed by figs, dates and dried fruits, with a very appealing, lingering aftertaste of fruits and hop bitterness.","style":"Scottish-Style Light Ale","category":"British Ale"}
