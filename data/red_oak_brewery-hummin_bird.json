We use carefully selected Pilsner Maltâ€¦then it is delicately hopped with imported Tettnang Noble Hops. Then we add a proprietary lager yeast strain which is not filtered out providing ones daily supply of vitamin B.  Hummin' Bird is slow-cold aged for over one month resulting in a lush mouth feel.","style":"American-Style Light Lager","category":"North American Lager"}
