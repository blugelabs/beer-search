It is a deep reddish brown color with a complex fruity nose, a very full body, and an interesting balance between grains and hops which ends with a pleasing dry taste. To fully enjoy all the flavours, this ale is best drunk at 55 degrees Fahrenheit.","style":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
