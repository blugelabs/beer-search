It pours into a glass with a bronze to brown color, fluffy white head and bready malt aroma. The Troegenator leaves a rich, warming feeling and subtle spicy flavors. The style, Double Bock, dates back a century or so ago. During periods of fasting without solid foods, the Monastic brewers relied on the double bock; a stronger, richer beer to fulfill their basic nutritional needs. Known to them as \"liquid bread,\" a double bock has a strong malt aroma and chewy rich body. Traditionally these brewers ended the name of their double bock with the suffix \"ator\", ex. Celabrator, Illuminator, Subliminator... In the spirit of the tradition we give you the Troegenator to provide warmth and richness through the early spring months. A double bock of epic proportions, beware,\r\nthe Troegenator is deceiving smooth and delicious.","style":"German-Style Doppelbock","category":"German Lager"}
