Deep amber hue with a generous white head, Hopmouth showcases a rich, toasty flavor and a sweet caramel notes as a result of the high-quality Maris Otter Malt, imported from the UK.  The hops are right up front in the aroma, reminiscent of citrus and pine, while the resin-like flavors linger well after the last sip.\r\n\r\nThis is a BIG beer.  True to our original vision, we have achieved a level of balance and drinkability rarely found in this style.  Delicious on its own, Hopmouth is also a brilliant pair with many boldly-flavored foods, including many cheeses and desserts.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
