The Hollow Earth Society. Members of the Spanish Inquisition. All convinced they were blessed with the gift of clarity. And proof that clarity might be overrated. \r\n\r\nSometimes, being unclear—and a little flexible—is a good thing. Like when you are looking for the perfect refreshment. Dundee Wheat Beer combines wheat and yeast into a refreshing hefeweizen-style brew. Unfiltered, so it is slightly cloudy and pleasantly unclear. \r\n\r\nSo the next time you’re convinced you’re right about what you’ve been drinking, give a little “unclarity” a try.\r\n\r\nAn American-style, unfiltered wheat beer. Pale straw in color with a light cloudiness from carefully selected wheat and yeast. Pleasant spicy malt aroma and a crisp hop finish.","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","category":"Other Style"}
