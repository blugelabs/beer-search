Code named by our brewers-\"The Big Black Nasty,\" this is monstrous dark ale is brewed to no particular style. Thick and sludgy like oil from the crankcase of a wheat threshing combine, Old Viscosity blurs the boundaries of Porter, Stout, Old Ale and Barleywines.\r\n\r\nA blended beer that mixes old and new brewing traditions into one finished beer, Old Viscosity starts out with 80% of the packaged beer produced from a stainless steel fermentation. It then joins another 20% Barrel Aged Old Viscosity (from a previous batch) that has been aging in bourbon barrels. The blend of the two beers yields an incredibly rich and luscious ale that reveals chocolate and cocoa notes melded to silky body of burnt wood, vanilla and ash.\r\n\r\nMalts- Two Row, Wheat, Domestic and English Crystal, Carafa III and Chocolate Malts\r\nHops- German Magnum \r\nYeast- White Labs California Ale and Proprietary Yeast Strains\r\n\r\nOriginal Gravity- 1.092\r\nTerminal Gravity- 1.014\r\n10.5 % ABV\r\n\r\nDraft- Available in Southern California and Arizona 22 Oz Bottles and Cases- At Port Brewing San Marcos and Pizza Port Carlsbad, San Clemente and Solana Beach and wherever better beers are sold.","style":"Old Ale","category":"British Ale"}
