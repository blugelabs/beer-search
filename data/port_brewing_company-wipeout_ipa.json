As you paddle out, a swell arrives from nowhere signaling your turn to go. The surf Gods are shinning on you today. You turn, stroke like mad for the wave. Standing up you are alone and blammo you Wipeout....blowing the only chance of a right hander all to yourself. You know who you are. We've all been there too. It's inside each and every one of us.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the waters of Wipeout IPA, a massively hopped India Pale Ale with enough substance and body to overcome even the worst and most tragic of on the water spills. We brew Wipeout IPA for everyone- especially those hardy souls who brave the cold winter water and monster sets produced by an amazing northwest swell. \r\n\r\nOnly a tidal wave of hops can overcome the surging tide of malt that is required to produce a beer of this shape. We invite you to drop in, hang on and kick out the backside. That is, unless you enjoy wiping out and all the glory that goes with it.\r\n\r\nMalts- Two Row, Wheat, Carapils and English Crystal Malts\r\nHops- Amarillo, Centennial and Simcoe \r\nYeast- White Labs California Ale\r\n\r\nOriginal Gravity- 1.064\r\nTerminal Gravity- 1.008\r\n7.0% ABV\r\n\r\nDraft- Available in Southern California and Arizona 22 Oz Bottles and Cases- At Port Brewing San Marcos and Pizza Port Carlsbad, San Clemente and Solana Beach and wherever better beers are sold.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
