The luxurious single wort (or first press) process yields a unique, complex flavor. With his gold label and \"Special Premium Reserve\" appellation, Ichiban outclasses and outperforms. But don't be fooled by a snooty attitude -- this is a great beer that goes with anything.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Ichiban great\r\nProminent wort. Finest barley malt, premium hops, smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste."}
