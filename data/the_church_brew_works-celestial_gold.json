The light body makes this lager beer appropriate for a business lunch or your evening sipping beer. The light malt flavor also accentuates the hop flavor. From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma. As you sip the Celestial Gold, the subdued maltiness blends with a slight hop flavor. When this beer finishes, you will notice a pleasant hop bitterness. The bitterness will be mild and quite appropriate.
