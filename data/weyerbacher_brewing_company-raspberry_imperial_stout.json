{"name":"Raspberry Imperial Stout","abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"weyerbacher_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Enjoyed alone as a winter-warmer or as the perfect finish to any fine meal, our Raspberry Imperial Stout is a wonderfully full-flavored beer with just a \"kiss\" of raspberry flavor. \r\nWhen we brew this beer we add just a touch of real raspberries during the fermentation process. The result is a modest fruit flavor which enhances--- without dominating the rich, malty, stout taste.\r\n\r\nOur Raspberry Imperial Stout (8.0% ABV) is great alone or as an after-dinner accompaniment. It's especially good with chocolate desserts. We brew it only during the winter months, so check out the Brewing Schedule on the \"What's New\"  page for the next time it will be coming to a beer store near you.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
