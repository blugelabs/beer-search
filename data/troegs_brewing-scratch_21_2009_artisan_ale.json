This Belgian Ale has distinct roots in The Mad Elf minus some key components.\r\n \r\nThe cherries? Gone.\r\nThe honey? Gone.\r\nThe chocolate malt? Gone.\r\n\r\nWait, this sounds familiar. It almost sounds like a naked version of The Mad Elf.\r\n \r\nComing in just under 8% ABV, this unfiltered golden beauty shows off the pronounced yeast flavor that made The Mad Elf famous as well as a touch of alcohol and some mellow malt flavors.","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
