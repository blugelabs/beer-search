Combining attitude, style substance and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say?\r\n\r\nYou really should just leave it alone...\r\n\r\n...but you just cant get the compulsive malt body and gorgeous dirty blonde colour out of your head. The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached.\r\n\r\nAll wrapped up with the customary Brewdog bite and imaginative twist. This trashy blonde is going to get you into a lot of trouble.","style":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
