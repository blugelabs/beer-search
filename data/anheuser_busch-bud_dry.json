It is brewed with select hops, grains and barley malt, which results in a lighter body and less-sweet taste. As with all Anheuser-Busch beers, it is cold-filtered for a smooth draft taste, but then goes through a second cold-filtered finishing process to provide its unique taste.","style":"American-Style Light Lager","category":"North American Lager"}
