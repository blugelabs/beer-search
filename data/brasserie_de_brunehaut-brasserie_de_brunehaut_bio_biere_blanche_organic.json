Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.\r\nPresents a light hazy yellow colour with citrus and coriander aromas and fairly subtle malt and hops on the palate. The finish is dry and satisfying. Hazy yellow golden colour. Lemon custard, lime zest, and delicate spice melange aromas. Well-balanced, a frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of nuts, baked oranges, and slightly phenolic mineral flavors. Finishes with a metallic ore dust, salt, and dried lemon fade. This beer is certified as organic.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
