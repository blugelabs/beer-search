{"name":"Saison Rue","abv":8.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"the_bruery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Saison Rue is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned, Belgian/French-style farmhouse ale. This is a beer of subtlety and complexity, with malted rye, spicy, fruity yeast notes, biscuit-like malt backbone, and a slight citrus hop character. With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain. Being a Saison, Saison Rue is ambiguous unto itself as it is a different beer when fresh and when aged. We hope you enjoy it in all of its incarnations.","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
