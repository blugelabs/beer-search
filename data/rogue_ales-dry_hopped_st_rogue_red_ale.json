Full aromatic punch of caramel, citrus fruit and melon, with underlying fresh earth tones. Sweet caramel notes up front are quickly taken over by an array of fruit and hops bitterness that lingers into the night. A more adventurous ale than most.\"\r\n\r\nReddish copper in color, a roasty malt flavor with a hoppy sprucy finish. Saint Rogue Red is made with two-row Harrington, Klages and Munich malts, along with Hugh Baird 30-37, 13-17 Carastan, and Crystal 70-80 malts (44.4% speciality grains .39 lbs grain per bottle); Chinook and Centennial hops. Saint Rogue Red is available in a 22-ounce bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and on draft. Saint Rogue Red Dry Hopped-a draft only variation with raw Centennial hops added to the keg, giving the beer an increased hop finish and intense hop aroma.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
