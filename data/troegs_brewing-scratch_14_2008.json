The nicely carbonated brew releases a honey-malt flavor that gives way to a tart crisp finish that masks the elevated ABV.\r\n\r\nWe use a blended yeast strain (Saison Dupont & Le Chouffe) to create the traditional peppery, spicy earthy flavors of the saison. Slight hints of ginger also come through in the finish.\r\n\r\nDrink it ‘til the wedding bells chime!","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
