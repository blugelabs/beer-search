{"name":"Imperial Pumpkin Ale","abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"weyerbacher_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more \"caramelly\" and \"pumpkiny\" than its faint brethren!  \r\n  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night, or match it up with a slice of pumpkin pie and fresh whipped cream.  \r\n  If you don't agree this is the mother of all pumpkin ales, then you just don't like mothers!","style":"Pumpkin Beer","category":"Other Style"}
