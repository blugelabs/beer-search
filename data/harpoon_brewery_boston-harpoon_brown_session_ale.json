{"name":"Harpoon Brown Session Ale","abv":4.3,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"harpoon_brewery_boston","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Harpoon Brown is brewed to accentuate the sweeter, rounder notes derived from six different malts, including a de-husked chocolate malt that adds a hint of chocolate. The blend of these malts produces a beer that is complex and delicious without being heavy. This drinkable beer is perfect as a session beer or paired with foods.\r\n\r\nThis is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade.  While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in \"extreme\" beers, the brewers of Harpoon wanted to create something they could sit down and enjoy over an extended period of time - a session beer.  At 4.3% alcohol by volume, the Harpoon Brown Ale has the lowest alcohol content of all Harpoon beers.\r\n\r\nHarpoon Brown Ale will be available in bottles and on draft beginning in March 2007.  An evening of celebrations to toast the beer's release will be held at locations throughout New England on Thursday, March 8th, including tastings at Harpoon's breweries in Boston, MA and Windsor, VT","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
