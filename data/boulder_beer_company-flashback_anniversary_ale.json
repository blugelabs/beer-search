This is the first beer we’ve made here that uses one single hop variety (Cascade) in the recipe in five separate additions. The fresh Cascade hop aroma and flavor is perfectly balanced with the dark roasted grains, making Flashback a very unique beer. We’re calling it an India Brown Ale to help illustrate its flavor to the consumer. It’s hoppy like an IPA but dark and roasty like a Brown Ale. Put them together and voila! Flashback at its finest!","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
