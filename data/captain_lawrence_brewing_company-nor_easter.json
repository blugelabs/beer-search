I brewed a similar beer to this one back in 1998, while I was home brewing out in California. Only this time around I decided to age it in bourbon barrels to add a new element to the already rich sensory profile. The combination of dark malt, elderberries and bourbon barrels makes for an interesting tasting experience. This is a sippinâ€™ beer, so sit back by the fire and enjoy. 12% alcohol by volume.","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
