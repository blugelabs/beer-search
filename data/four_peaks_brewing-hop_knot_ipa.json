Including our cavernous hop-back, which gets so stuffed with whole leaf hops that we feel genuine guilt for its excess. Hop Knot is an ale that is to be enjoyed with friends, spicy food or any time you need a good hop fix without the harsh bitterness. We hope you enjoy this pioneering beer made in the bold spirit of Americans everywhere. \r\n\r\nAlcohol content approximately 6.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
