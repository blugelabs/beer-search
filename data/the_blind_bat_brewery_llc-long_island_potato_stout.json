(My French blood, not so much.) The local, Long Island agriculture booster in me needs to go for the Long Island potato above all others. \r\n\r\nWith a brewery this small (basically a home brewery with a license to sell), I can brew what \"gets\" me, with hopes that some folks will enjoy it.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
