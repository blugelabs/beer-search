His name meant \"the black sparrow hawk.\"  He came to be known as Black Hawk.  Strong beliefs, independent thinking and an unwavering commitment to his family and his people earned him a reputation as a man of integrity and courage.  In 1832, along with 1,200 of his people, Black Hawk was driven from his ancestral home during a war that bears his name.  We celebrate this Sauk leader and his courage with our BlackHawk Porter, the kind of beer that make you say, Ma-ka-tai-she-kia-kiak!\r\n\r\nChief BlackHawk Porter is a robust black and sharply bittersweet ale.  This style was traditionally the session beer consumed by the porters in London.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
