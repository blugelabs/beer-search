{"name":"Colonel Blide's Cask Ale","abv":5.5,"ibu":31.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"cricket_hill","updated":"2010-12-06 13:08:34","description":"A tasty, moderately hoppy, easy to drink beer with an orange marmalade hue with a frothy, off-white head. An herbal hop aroma with a hint of lemon and pine. This beer is not overly bitter, with orangy citrus and pine hop with slight earthy notes! There is a malty biscuit flavor that balances the hops. Makes me wish I had some Fish & Chips!!","style":"Ordinary Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
