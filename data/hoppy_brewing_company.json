We are brewing all of our products here in Sacramento and have 10 products on tap here at the brewpub. In addition, our current California distribution network consists of just one hard working distributor: A & D Distributing. We utilize this established distributor in their selected market to sell principally to the packaged/bottle market through authorized retail outlets, and the on-premises draft market through establishments licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. Our core products (i.e., Hoppy Face, Liquid Sunshine and Total Eclipse) are currently available in draft and 22 ounce bottles, and only available in the Sacramento and San Jose areas, but that will likely change as we continue to expand this year.","address":["6300 Folsom Boulevard"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":38.5551,"lon":-121.43}}
