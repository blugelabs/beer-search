The line at the DMV. The commencement address. Winter. \r\n\r\nBut take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thought—and an itchy wool robe—sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. \r\n\r\nSo when you’re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.\r\n\r\nA traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops.","style":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","category":"German Lager"}
