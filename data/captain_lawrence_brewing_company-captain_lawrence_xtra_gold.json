We have taken the best qualities from both styles and allowed them to shine through. The fruity and spicy notes from the imported Belgian yeast strain & the pungent flavors and aromas of the American grown Amarillo hops flow seamlessly together to create this flavorful ale.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
