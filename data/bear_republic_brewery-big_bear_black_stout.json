This bold stout boasts a rich, caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your teeth into. ...Big Bear's bold flavors are produced using a blend of Belgian and English roasted barley and crystal malts. Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt. This is a balanced bold brew boasting an A.V.B. of 8.1% that can creep up on you, \"so don't get mauled\". It has a dry roasted quality that masks its' high alchohol content, so drink responsibly. 2004 California State Fair, Silver Medal Winner; 2002 World Beer Cup, Gold Medal Winner; \r\n2002 Annual Bistro Beer Festival, Hayward, Gold Medal Winner; 2001 North American Brewers' Award, Honorable Mention - og 1.076, ABV 8.1%, IBU 68.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
