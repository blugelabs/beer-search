Abundant American hops offer grapefruit, pine, must and mint, which play off the fullness and sweetness of pale malts then provide a biting yet enticing finish.\r\n\r\nMayhem Double IPA accents the complex spice combinations found in Thai, Indian, Cajun, Morrocan, Mexican and Southwest American cuisines as well as BBQ marinades, dry rubs and sauces.\r\n\r\nMayhem creates MAYHEM.","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
