The enticing regal aromas of toffee and licorice lead to the coronation of taste; a palate of malty richness exhibiting chocolate and coffee notes, balanced by the noble and novel Mt. Rainer hop, all topped with a rich creamy crown. This very special offering will warm your soul and lift your spirits. Oh yeah, it also packs a royal kick at 8% alcohol.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
