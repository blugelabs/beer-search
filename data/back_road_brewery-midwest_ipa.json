It's all about the hops on this one.  Brewers use hops to add bitterness and aroma to their beers.  If not for hops your beer would be too sweet.  Our IPA uses plenty of Chinook and Columbus hops from the Pacific Northwest.  The flavor can best be described as strong resiny grapefruit.  The long drawn out hop flavor is essential to the character of the beer.  So smack your buds on this one all you HOP HEADS.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
