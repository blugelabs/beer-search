{"name":"High Tide IPA","abv":6.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"port_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"ach and every fall, we experience a coastal experience in San Diego known as the \"Super High Tide.\" This happens later in the Fall Season when the tidal swings reach a range of about 8 feet in difference between low and high tides. When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
