All three of the lambics - Raspberry, Blackberry and Black Cherry - are aged in oak casks for more than one year. 15 kg, give or take, of whole unpasteurized fruit is added to each 200 litre oak barrel of fermented beer. The naturally occurring wild yeasts cause a second, slow fermentation, breaking down the fruit sugars to total dryness.","style":"Fruit Beer","category":"Other Style"}
