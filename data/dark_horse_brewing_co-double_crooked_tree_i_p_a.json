{"name":"Double Crooked Tree I.P.A.","abv":13.6,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"dark_horse_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"From their website:\r\n\"Have you read the description for the regular Crooked Tree yet? Well this beer is almost the same just double. We actually took the Crooked Tree recipe and doubled all of the ingredients except the water, just the way a DOUBLE should be made. Big hops balanced with tons of malt give this beer a huge body. Although this beer is as cool as \"the Fonz\"  when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age. After a year or two stored in a cool dark place you'll notice the heavy caramel and malt flavors are trying to sneak past the hops, theyâ€™re just not fast enough. This beer is hugely delicious so it will need your undivided attention (the chores can wait....trust us).\"","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
