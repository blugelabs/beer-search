{"name":"Pride of Milford Special Ale","abv":7.7,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"cooperstown_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"\"Pride of Milford\" is a very special ale with a tapestry of complex flavors and aromas. It is brewed with five malts and fermented with the Ringwood yeast at a higher temperature which gives this beer a uniqueness all its own. \"Pride\" has a distinctive reddish copper color. It is strong and rich beer. When \"Pride\" was first brewed in December 1999, many thought the flavor and aromas of this beer had fruit overtones. No fruit or adjunct flavoring is added to this beer. The unique flavor comes from our special brewing process."}
