{"name":"Cumberland Brewery","city":"Louisville","state":"Kentucky","code":"40205","country":"United States","phone":"(502) 458-8727","website":"","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Giving new meaning to the term microbrewery, Cumberland Brews may be one of the smallest eateries in town, with a half-dozen four-top tables and a short bar with nine stools making tight quarters of what used to be the White Mountain Creamery. (Techically, it's not a microbrewery but a brewpub - a restaurant that makes its own beer on the premises - but I'm not one to quibble in the face of a good pun.) It's usually packed, too, earning its crowds the old-fashioned way by providing very good food, friendly service, and the sine qua non for a brewpub: extremely high-quality hand-crafted artisan beers. Hand-crafted offerings are produced by Head Brewer Cameron Finnis.","address":["1576 Bardstown Rd"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":38.2309,"lon":-85.7055}}
