Well-hopped and fermented to a crisp dryness, Saisons were brewed in the spring to sustain farmers through the summer. Saison de Brooklyn is boldly hoppy, dry and flinty, with a bright spicy, citric aroma and pillowy white head. This beer has remarkable versatility with food, complementing spicy dishes particularly well.","style":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
