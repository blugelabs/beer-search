One taste and you’ll find yourself right smack in the middle of Hop Head Heaven!  But this beer has more to offer than just hops.  We use tons of the finest malted barley available to balance out this beer.  The result of our efforts is a beer with a magnitude of hop aroma and bite, yet perfectly balanced with a clean, crisp malty flavor.  WARNING: This beer is not intended for the masses that prefer a mild domestic beer,  It’s big, bold characteristics and 7.1% a.b.v. are not intended for the weak.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
