The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\nYou will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nDiscover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately."}
