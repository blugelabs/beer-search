The opportunity to rediscover some flavour highlights of beer styles enjoyed on summer days past, and bring them back to life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last century, in England, Europe and the Americas and in New Zealand, there was still an adherence to brew with barley, wholesome grains, hops and other traditional brewing spices.\r\n\r\nMonteith’s Summer Ale is a bright gold beer with great body from four different malts. Spiced with a single hop variety and a touch of history - a little Rata honey. Subtle, but enough to make all the difference. The result is a truly refreshing herbal spiced beer brewed for the Summer Season — a splendid thirst quencher.\r\n\r\nMonteith’s Summer Ale enjoyed ice-cold with a simple range of fruits, perhaps refreshing wedge of orange or lime. Alternatively, match with summer salads and stir-frys to complement the light flavours.","style":"Herb and Spice Beer","category":"Other Style"}
