A second location, in Royersford, PA, was opened in 2004 and includes a full production brewery as well as an accompanying restaurant. Head brewer is Brian O'Reilly, a multi-GABF Medal winner. Sly Fox packages its beers in cans, 22oz and 750ml bottles, but not in the standard 12oz-er. The pub is noted for its annual Bock Festival & Goat Race (winning goat's name goes on the year's MaiBock) and the IPA Project, a year-long program of single varietal beers culminating in an Imperial IPA using all those varietals, released at a day-long party every December when all the IPAs are on draught.","address":["519 Kimberton Road"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":40.1298,"lon":-75.5499}}
