These brewers conspired during barley wine fest week to brew up a deviously delicious dark Belgian-style beer. \r\n\r\nConspiracy is opaque black with a creamy beige head. Black malt shrouds it in mystery; the Belgian yeast imparts intriguing flavor; the alcohol adds danger. If you're up for this mission, watch your back.\r\n\r\nConspiracy will be released in Anchorage and Portland in April 2007.","style":"Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
