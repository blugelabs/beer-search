It is named after the infamous LaPorte, Indiana serial killer herself, Belle Gunness of 1908.  This Irish-style dry stout is amazingly smooth to drink.  You will taste chocolate, coffee and roasty flavors in every sip.  Don't be afraid of the dark.  A true dark beer lover would die to try it.  It definitely would not kill you to dig some up.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
