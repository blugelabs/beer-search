The Malt Advocate described Youngers Special Bitter as \"rich and flavorful. A triad of caramel maltiness, fruitiness (apricots?), and hop bitterness in aroma and flavor. A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales, with some background spiciness. Dry, hoppy finish.\" In the SouthWest Brewing News, Feb/March 1994 issue, George Fix wrote \"A strong case could be made for Rogue Ale being included among the top 5 ales brewed in the US.\"\r\n\r\nYSB is amber in color with a mild hoppy finish. Brewed with a blend of 2-row Harrington and Crystal malts, Willamette and East Kent Golding hops. YSB is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (the 12-ounce 6-pack was phased out in early 2005), and on draft.","style":"Extra Special Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
