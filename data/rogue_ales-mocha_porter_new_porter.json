Mocha Porter was once known as New Porter, in honor of the town of Newport, Oregon and home of Rogue Ales. The January/February 1995 issue of Mens Health magazine features a bottle of Rogue New Porter (todays Mocha Porter) in the Fifth Annual Collection of Good Advise, Health News, Dire Warnings, Notable Folks and Unsolicited Opinion. New Porter is described as the Best New Beer for 1994! The caption reads: \"Oh, Hoppy Day: For a beer- drinking experience order up a bottle of this microbrew from Oregon.\"\r\n\r\nRuddy brown in color, a bittersweet balance of malt and hops with a light cream finish. Mocha Porter is made from Northwest Harrington and Klages; 135-165, 95-115, and 70-80 Crystal; Beeston Chocolate, Black, Munich and Carastan malts. Perle and Centennial hops.
