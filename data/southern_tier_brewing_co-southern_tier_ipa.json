IPA's namesake lies in its colonial roots.  British soldiers on their way to India drank a lot of beer, but found it would go stale on the long voyages.  Meanwhile, brewers knew that by adding more hops the beer would stay fresh.  Voila!  A new style was born and it is one we are proud to brew.  Southern Tier IPA is triple-hopped on its journey to your glass for a fully aromatic experience.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
