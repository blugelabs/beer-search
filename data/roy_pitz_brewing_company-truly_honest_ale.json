This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly \"Honest\" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale, unlike many other bitter American ales.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
