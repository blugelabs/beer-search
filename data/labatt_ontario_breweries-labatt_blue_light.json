Blue Light uses specially selected North American aromatic hops and the same strain of lager yeast as the one used to produce Labatt Blue. The result is a crisp, clean and delicately balanced beer, with a slight sweetness and citrus-like hop character.","style":"American-Style Light Lager","category":"North American Lager"}
