The yeast I chose for this beer comes from one of the 7 Trappist breweries.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this is the first time in my professional brewing career that I have used dextrose (corn syrup) in a Terrapin brew. True to style no doubt.\r\n\r\n“Monk’s Revenge” (otherwise known as the “Big Nasty”) has all the flavor and aroma of a Double IPA while hidden beneath lies the malt character of a fine Belgian Tripel.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my interpretation of this very fun style.","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
