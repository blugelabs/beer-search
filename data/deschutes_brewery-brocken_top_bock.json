Czech Saaz hops balance a diverse malt composition that creates the flavor, color and mouth feel.  The lager yeast chosen for this beer plays an important role in the flavor contribution, adding sweet fruit overtones.  This bock boasts a clever 7% alcohol by volume so don’t let it “kick” you off of your stool.","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","category":"German Lager"}
