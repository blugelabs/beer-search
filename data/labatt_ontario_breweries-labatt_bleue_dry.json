Labatt Bleue Dry is mashed longer than regular beers to leave less carbohydrate (sugar) in the finished beer, giving a clean, crisp finish. Using select aromatic hops and a blend of the finest quality North American barley malts, this lager is clean-flavoured with no aftertaste.","style":"German-Style Pilsener","category":"German Lager"}
