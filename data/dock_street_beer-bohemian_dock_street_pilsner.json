We use costly Bohemian Saaz hops and pale imported malts to produce its rich golden color, and soft malty flavor using traditional techniques of the old world. True Pilsners are the most difficult to brew as there are no dark malts or flavorings used to mask flaws. Pilsner is the best known style of beer in the world. A good pilsner balances hops and malts to a refreshing, clean tasting, every-mood kind of beer. The Bohemian can stand alone or join a party easily.","style":"German-Style Pilsener","category":"German Lager"}
