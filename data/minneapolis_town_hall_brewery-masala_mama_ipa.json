Masala Mama uses three different West Coast varieties, over five hop additions. This copper-colored ale is not strictly about hops; American pale barley and several caramel malts balance the flavor for a green, toasted caramel finish. The British realized an abundance of hops will help preserve beer â€¦ we realized hops can preserve our customers.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
