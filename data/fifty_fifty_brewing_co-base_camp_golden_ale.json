{"name":"Base Camp Golden Ale","abv":4.9,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"fifty_fifty_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"The lightest of FiftyFifty's ales, Base Camp is a thirst quenching delight. Pale straw to light gold in color, this beer has a mild malt flavor combined with light bitterness and hop flavor. This beer finishes dry and is very light and refreshing on the palate. Base Camp is a \"session beer\", meaning you can easily toss back a few in one sitting. So go ahead, pull up a chair and camp out for awhile.","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
