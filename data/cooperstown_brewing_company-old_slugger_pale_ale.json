It is brewed with four barley malts, including two-row English pale and crystal malts, balanced with Mt. Hood, Cascade and Fuggle hops, and fermented in open vessels by Ringwood Yeast, a true top-fermenting ale yeast. \"Old Slugger\" is the flagship beer of the Cooperstown Brewing Company and was first brewed in July 1995 and bottled in November 1995.","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
