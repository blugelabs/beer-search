New Zealand’s super alpha hops give Haywards Black a unique and pleasantly bitter taste with a hop like aroma. The Dark Roasted malt provides a rich dark colouring along with a unique smoky taste and aroma. The Slow brewing process which incorporates specially managed yeast creates the creamy head and the rich smooth taste that stout is so much loved for. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sabmiller.in/brands_haywards_black.html","style":"American-Style Lager","category":"North American Lager"}
