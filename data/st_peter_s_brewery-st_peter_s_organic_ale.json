Organic hops provide the distinctive palate. The yeast used is St. Peter’s own single strand variety. The result is a delicate, clean, crisp, lightly carbonated, traditional English Ale with a full ‘citrus hop’ aftertaste. This lovely beer won the Soil Association’s top prize in 2002 and a silver medal in 2006.","style":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","category":"British Ale"}
