The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeusâ€™s daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander.","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
