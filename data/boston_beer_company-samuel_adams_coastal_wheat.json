These particular lemons added the perfect balance of citrus tartness and sweetness to accent the taste of the beer.  The spiciness of the Hallertau Mittelfruh and Spalt Spalter hops balance out the slightly sweet character of our breweryâ€™s own signature wheat malt, resulting in a crisp and refreshing wheat beer with a subtle lemon aroma and flavor.","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
