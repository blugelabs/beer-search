The red color and slight caramel-roasted flavor comes from generous amounts of caramel malts and a touch of chocolate malts. Well hopped to balance the malty sweetness, and dry-hopped with cascade for a full hop flavor and aroma.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
