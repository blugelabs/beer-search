They have 5 main brews, but the 2 I love most are their Pale Ale and Cream Ale.  The Pale Ale has a great hoppy finish, while the Cream Ale has a nice smooth taste. They also have a few other great brews!","address":["55 Emerald Industrial Park Road"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":48.3003,"lon":-116.538}}
