Malty and roasty on the palate, and with distinctive caramel notes, this beer will satisfy the desires of any malty beer aficionado. \r\n\r\nWeyerbacher Scotch Ale is our interpretation of a beer style originating from Scotland, where the chilly damp weather calls for a hearty beer. Lacking the preservative powers of hops, scotch ales were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.7% ABV (alcohol by volume) Weyerbacher Scotch Ale definitely contains a warming belt.\r\n\r\nWe brew Weyerbacher Scotch Ale mostly in the cooler months of the year.
