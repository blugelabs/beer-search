Alaskan ESB is darker and hoppier and is brewed and fermented at different temperatures than our popular Alt-style Amber. It has an exquisite copper color derived from Crystal malt and an aggressive, yet pleasant hop character.\r\n\r\nMalty with roasted overtones, Alaskan ESB has a crisp finish resulting from the use of premium Northwest hops.\r\n\r\nAlaskan ESB is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.","style":"Extra Special Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
