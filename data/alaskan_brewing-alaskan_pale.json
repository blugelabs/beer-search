A blonde, lighter bodied beer with a floral aroma and a crisp, hoppy finish that's not bitter. The hop character of Alaskan Pale is due to dry hopping by hand during the fermentation process.\r\n\r\nA clean, softly malted body with a hint of citrus overtones, followed by a hop-accented dry, crisp finish.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Pale is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend or European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row pale and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and the more than 90 inches or rainfall we receive each year.","style":"Golden or Blonde Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
