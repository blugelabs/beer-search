Shipping over long distances is not always a friend to beer. \r\n\r\nNamed for the Centerport-Greenlawn area of Long Island that is home to the Blind Bat Brewery, Harborfields Hefeweizen goes great with fish, chicken, or a summer salad. Some even like it with brunch! (Please enjoy your waffles responsibly.)","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
