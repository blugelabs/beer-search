{"name":"Eleven","abv":11.7,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"weyerbacher_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Our Eleventh anniversy ale, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew.","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
