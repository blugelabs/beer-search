Dubbed ‘Citra of Brotherly Love’ in honor of Philly Beer week, Scratch #31 has generous amounts of Apollo, Cascade and Citra hops. This is our first use of Citra hops, which is known for an intense grapefruit aroma and flavor.\r\n\r\nWhile showcasing the intense Citra flavor we added additional bitterness with Apollo and Chinook hops as well. Scratch #31 went through a bed of Chinook hops in the hopback and was dry-hopped with Cascade and Citra hops.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
