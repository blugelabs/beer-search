And we can think of no better way to describe the taste of this even-bolder take on our classic, Black Butte Porter. Black Butte XX is an imperial porter with a lot more malt and hops, a wealth of coffee, cocoa nibs and aged in bourbon oak barrels. XX. It also means 20. Enjoy one during our 20th anniversary. On the flavor scale - Itâ€™s legendary.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
