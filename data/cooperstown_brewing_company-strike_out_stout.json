It is also brewed with 5% flaked oats for a velvet-like mouth feel. English pale, Munich and black malt, plus roasted barley round out the malt bill. Considerably lower in alcohol than both Benchwarmer Porter and Old Slugger Pale Ale, \"Strike Out\" is a well-rounded stout, opaque black in color with a roasted palate.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
