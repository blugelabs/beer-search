It is spicy, vinous, and deliciously complex with a crisp hop finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robust maltiness and  spiciness of our\r\namber-red ale is counterbalanced by an\r\nassertive hop finish, offering a distinctive\r\nflavor that is cognac-like in complexity.","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
