From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.","address":["5763 Arapahoe Avenue"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":40.0166,"lon":-105.219}}
