{"name":"Hopworks Urban Brewery","city":"Portland","state":"Oregon","code":"97202","country":"United States","phone":"(503) 201-8957","website":"http://hopworksbeer.com/","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"HUB is Portland's first Eco-Brewpub to offer all organic handcrafted beers, fresh local ingredients, and a sustainable building with a relaxed and casual atmosphere. Brewmaster Christian Ettinger has spent the past year and half constructing his dream brewpub.  HUB incorporates all aspects of sustainability.  From composting to rain barrels, and from pervious pavers to hand dryers, we have made every effort to protect our future with a thoughtful alternative.  Hopworks has four distinct areas including a family friendly restaurant with play area, a vibrant bicycle bar, banquet mezzanine, and outdoor beer-garden.  Our 20 barrel brewery produces 3000 barrels a year and provides our restaurant with ten different HUB organic beers on tap and two cask ales at all times. We have parking for seventy cars, eight motorcycles and up to fifty bikes.  Our world-class beer, New York style pizza, and wonderful staff are some of the best you will find anywhere.","address":["2944 SE Powell Blvd"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":45.4969,"lon":-122.635}}
