Traditionally malty with the warming sensation of alcohol, Olde Ales are brewed in the fall as winter warmers.\r\n\r\nBrewed in the style of an English Olde Ale, this ale balances the sweet heady aroma of spruce tips with the clean crisp finish of noble hops. Its malty richness is complemented by the warming sensation of alcohol.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Winter is made from glacier-fed water, Sitka spruce tips and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.","style":"Winter Warmer","category":"Other Style"}
