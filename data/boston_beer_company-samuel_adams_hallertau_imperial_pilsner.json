This rare Noble Bavarian hop, considered to be one of the best in the world, is prized for its quality and aromatic characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe beer, which is a deep golden color with a rich, creamy head, gives off an intense and complex Noble hop aroma unlike any other brew. With the first sip, beer enthusiasts will experience an explosion of hop flavor. The intensity of deep citrus, spicy Noble hop flavor is balanced with the slight sweetness from the malt. Due to the quality of the hops, this beer remains balanced and smoothly drinkable from beginning to end. The lingering \"hop signature\" is an amazing treat for hops lovers."}
