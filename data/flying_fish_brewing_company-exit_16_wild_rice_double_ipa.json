{"name":"Exit 16 - Wild Rice Double IPA","abv":8.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"flying_fish_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"The fourth stop on our multi-year trip to explore New Jersey takes us to one of the most maligned places in the state- the Hackensack Meadowlands. It’s the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say they’re from New York.\r\n\r\nAlthough no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, we’ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.\r\n\r\nRice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops we’ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
