Very low bitterness. It is unfiltered so the characteristic cloudiness is achieved. The haze comes from suspended yeast. Hefe-Weizen literally means \"yeast-wheat.\" The aroma is reminiscent of cloves and banana and is put out by the yeast. While some of this aroma carries over to the flavor, the dominant flavor is the malty wheat. \r\n\r\nAlcohol content approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
