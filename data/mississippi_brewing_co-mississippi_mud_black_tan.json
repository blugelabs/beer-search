The description on the bottle says it all.\r\n\r\nS-It's got a coffee like smell to it. It smells pretty good.\r\n\r\nT- It tastes a tad like Bass with a hint of coffee to it. At least to me it had a coffee taste. It's got a nice even taste. It's not too strong and not too weak. It's a happy medium.\r\n\r\nM-It feels good when swallowing. It leaves a mild aftertaste but it's a good aftertaste.\r\n\r\nD-Well I drank the whole jug w/ no problem and enjoyed myself so that spoke for itself.\r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this beer. If you find it, it's worth having. It goes well when watching a movie too.\r\n\r\nServing type: bottle"}
