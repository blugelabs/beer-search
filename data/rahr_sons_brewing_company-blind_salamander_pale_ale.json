These beers are dedicated to improving the lot of\r\nendangered Texas species. Rahr is making donations from these proceeds\r\nto the Texas Parks & Wildlife Foundation to help with the recovery\r\nof these species. \r\n\r\nThe Texas Blind Salamander is a rare cave dwelling troglobite amphibian native to San\r\nMarcos, specifically the San Marcos Pool in the Edwards Aquifer. It has\r\nbright red external gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. Its\r\nmature length is 5 cm and its diet varies by what flows into its cave,\r\nincluding shrimp, snails and amphipods. \r\n\r\nBlind Salamander Pale Ale is a blend of the finest pale malts and East Kent\r\nGoldings hops. The fine balance of these toasted caramel malts and\r\nearthy hops makes Blind Salamander an easy drinking and satisfying ale.","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
