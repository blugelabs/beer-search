It has a deep amber color and an exceptionally full-bodied, complex character. Generous quantities of premium Cascade hops give the Pale Ale its fragrant bouquet and spicy flavor. \r\n\r\n“Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the flagship beer, the one that made Chico famous. It is a flawless beer that opens with bright, perky high notes of maltiness and orange blossom and segues into a delectable hoppiness.”\r\n\r\n– Elaine Louie, Premier Beer—A Guide to America's Best Bottled Microbrews\r\n \r\n   \r\n  \r\nGOLD MEDAL WINNER\r\nGreat American Beer Festival (American Pale Ale: 1995, 1994, 1993; \r\nClassic English Pale Ale: 1992; Pale Ale: 1990, 1989, 1987)","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
