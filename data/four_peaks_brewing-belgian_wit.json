This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\r\n\r\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \r\n\r\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called \"Hoof - Hearted Wit,\" and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
