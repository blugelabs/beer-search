{"name":"Planet Bean Coffee Stout","abv":7.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"spring_house_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Brewed to give the stout a smoother, almost slick, mouthfeel with a nice finish of coffee provided by Cumberland Coffee and Tea Company. Dark malts are used to give this beer a very complex roast flavor. Lower bittering rates ~30 IBUâ€™s helps put the flavor highlighting the maltiness, and roasted malt. ABV is coming in around 7% on this one!"}
