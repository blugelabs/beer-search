The barley kernels are kilned at very high temperatures until they are dark brown to black in color. \r\nThe Susquehanna River is named after the Susquehannock Indians who settled in our area. This shallow river is over one mile wide in the Harrisburg area and flows from southern New York through Pennsylvania to the Chesapeake Bay.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
