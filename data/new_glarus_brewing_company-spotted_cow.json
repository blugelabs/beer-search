We continue this pioneer spirit with our Wisconsin farmhouse ale. Brewed with flaked barley and the finest Wisconsin malts. We even give a nod to our farmers with a little hint of corn. \r\n\r\nNaturally cloudy we allow the yeast to remain in the bottle to enhance fullness of flavors, which cannot be duplicated otherwise. \r\n\r\nExpect this ale to be fun, fruity and satisfying. You know you're in Wisconsin when you see the Spotted Cow.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
