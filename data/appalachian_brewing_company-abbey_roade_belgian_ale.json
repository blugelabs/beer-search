This wonderful brew is soft and sweet up front.  The complex and spicy middle palate is in most part due to the generous addition of dark Belgian candy sugar.  This semi-dry ale has notes of ripe plum and pear with a peppery finish. \r\nThe origins of the Abbey-style ale date back to the Middle Ages.  Monks residing in monasteries, called Abbeys, brewed beer as a source of nutrition during their frequent and often lengthy fasting periods.","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
