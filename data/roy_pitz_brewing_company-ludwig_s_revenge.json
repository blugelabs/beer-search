{"name":"Ludwig's Revenge","abv":5.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"roy_pitz_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, \"Ludwigs Brewery\" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier, or dark smoked lager. This beer uses all its ingredients from Bamberg, Germany, which is where the style was born and in by coincidence, the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago."}
