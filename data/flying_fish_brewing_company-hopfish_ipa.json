{"name":"HopFish IPA","abv":6.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"flying_fish_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"At the request of you hopheads, we produced this I.P.A. with a deep golden color, plenty of hop bitterness balanced by malt sweetness. Because of the extensive dry hopping, there's a floral and citrus hop finish. It's then lightly filtered to maintain the appropriate body and flavor. The beer features a combination of American, English and German malts to balance the large amount of hops. The HopFish also uses three hop varieties at five different times and has been dry-hopped for two weeks with 22lbs of Nugget whole leaf hops.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
