It's where we live.  It's where we work.  When we started this project we decided to pursue three businesses.  Just so we wouldn't get bored.  The lodging business includes five rooms at the Inn, and two Cottages on Shake Rag Street.  Then there is the Brewpub Restaurant in the Commerce Street building.  Last but certainly not least is the Brewery Creek Brewing Company, behind the glass doors of the restaurant. Our brewery is a modern, 15-barrel brew house capable of making up to 3,000 barrels of beer per year. I an make ales or lagers, but mostly it has been ales, which tend to have a more complex flavor profile.  I can use a simple one step infusion mash, or more elaborate multi-temperature steps.","address":["23 Commerce Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":42.8606,"lon":-90.1772}}
