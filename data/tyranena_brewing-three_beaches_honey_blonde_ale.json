Three Beaches Honey Blonde is like a day at the beach... light, bleached blonde, gleefully effervescent, free from bitterness and sure to improve your attitude. When you need a little attitude adjustment, spend a day at the beach with Three Beaches Honey Blonde... and you won't even have to wash the sand out of your suit!\r\n\r\nThree Beaches Honey Blonde is our Wisconsin version of the American Blonde Ale.
