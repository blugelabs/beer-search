Porter has a heavier flavour and aroma and a slightly sweet taste. Its name probably originates in the belief that this strong, nourishing drink was ideal for hard-working porters and labourers. Black Creek Porter is wonderful on its own, or with salty snacks.\n\n","style":"Smoke Beer","category":"Other Style"}
