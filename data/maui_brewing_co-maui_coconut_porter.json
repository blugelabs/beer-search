It is black in color and crowned with a creamy, dark tan head.   It begins with a malty-toasted coconut aroma followed by a rich, silky feel with tastes of dark malt, chocolate, and hints of coffee.  It then finishes with flavors of  toasted coconut and hoppy spice to balance the finish.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
