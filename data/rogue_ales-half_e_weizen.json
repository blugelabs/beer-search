Mo was a restaurateur and raconteur whose clam chowder is world-famous; Dutch a leader by example for coastal fisherman. Together their spirit indelibly shapes the daily lives of the Newport, OR waterfront.\r\n\r\nHalf-e-Weizen is a refreshing, unfiltered fusion of wheat and Northwest Harrington malts, coriander, ginger, and Saaz hops in the Belgium style. Half-e-Weizen is available in the classic 22-ounce bottle and on draft.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
