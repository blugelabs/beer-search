It was originally brewed as a winter ale under the name Tournay de Noel, but later became a year-round release.  They didn't provide much specific detail about how it was brewed except to say that it is made with water, malts, candi-sugar, hops, and yeast.  It is 7.6% ABV with a recommended drinking temperature of +/- 50 degrees.  The brewer states that the tasting notes are of, \"roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, earth, and cigar ash.\"  Well, I am a prodigious cigar smoker and I can't say that I would want to consume the ash.","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
