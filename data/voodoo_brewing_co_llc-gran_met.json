We use Cane and Beet sugar, along with German Pilsner Malt to create the unique flavor of this age old style. We also use a unique fermentation process of slowly adding the sugars to the fermentation during fermentation. This allows the yeast to more slowly ferment the beer without overloading the yeast. This process allows for a more clean, tight flavor profile.10% alc by vol. \r\n\r\nBottle Conditioned and Refermented.","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
