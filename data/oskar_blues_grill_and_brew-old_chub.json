{"name":"Old Chub","abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"oskar_blues_grill_and_brew","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Old Chub is a Scottish strong ale brewed with hearty amounts of seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts, and a smidge of US and UK hops. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany, home of the world's greatest smoked beers. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume.  While Dale's satisfies our hop addiction, Old Chub takes care of our deep affections for malt.  The cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.  Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate. We call it Rocky Mountain Mutha's Milk. People who tell us defiantly, \"I don't drink dark beer,\" often fall deeply in love with Old Chub. We can't blame them.","style":"Scotch Ale","category":"British Ale"}
