Brown ales seem to be there, but not really there, do you know what I mean? Well that won't be the mistake with Wynona! We Voodooed out this style and added more that's what we say. Mildly hoppy and smooth with hints of chocolate and tons of brown malt to let you know it's there. Currently 7.3% by vol. \r\n\r\nBottle conditioned and Refermented. \r\n\r\nGet down with the brown, You'll be Happy You Did!!","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
