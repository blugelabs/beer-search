This is our most popular ale due to its smooth and malty flavor.\r\n\r\nWe use a mixture of pale, crystal and black malts in this one, and our primary hop is Target, though we also add some Whitbread Goldings Variation as well.\r\n\r\nThe Real Ale is best fresh, so fresh in fact, that it's great right out of the bright tank."}
