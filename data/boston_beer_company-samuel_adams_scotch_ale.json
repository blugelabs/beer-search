It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey. This unique malt gives Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish.","style":"Scotch Ale","category":"British Ale"}
