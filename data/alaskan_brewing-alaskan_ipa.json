This style possesses medium maltiness and body while also being crisp and dry. Citrus flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.\r\n\r\nAlaskan IPA is honey gold in color with a fruity, citrus aroma. An enticing blend of hops and our dry hopping process, in which hops are added directly to tanks during fermentation, give this brew a very intense, complex aromatic character with a refreshing hop finish.\r\n\r\nAlaskan IPA is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from more than 90 inches of rainfall each year.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
