Brewed with a generous portion of wheat and our own special blend of spices, this beer is light and slightly cloudy in appearance, with a spicy aroma. Overall, it is a beer that is very drinkable and smooth any time of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable in: 12 oz and 750 ml bottles, 15.5 and 5.17 gal kegs\r\nABV: 5.0%\r\nOriginal Gravity: 1048\r\nRecommended Serving Temp: 34°F to 50°F","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
