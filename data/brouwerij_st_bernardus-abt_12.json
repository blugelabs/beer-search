It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %).\r\nA dark ivory coloured beer with a high fermentation. \r\n\r\nThe show piece of the brewery. Thanks to its soft and unconditionally genuine aroma, the beer can be smoothly tasted.  The Abt has a very fruity flavour.","style":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
