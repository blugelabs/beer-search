{"name":"Gubna Imperial IPA","abv":10.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"oskar_blues_grill_and_brew","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
