Created with equal parts malted wheat and pale two-row malt, Old Whiskers is lightly hopped to style. A unique Bavarian strain of yeast imparts a clove- or banana-like aroma and flavor. (We swear we did not put cloves into the brew. It is the magical powers of The Yeast.) Old Whisker is delicious and refeshing--the perfect summer quencher, served with or without a slice of lemon.","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
