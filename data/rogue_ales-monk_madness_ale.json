Five layers of malt create a complex, slightly sweet flavor balanced by five different hop varieties. A versatile and robust ale, we recommend pairing this with spicy foods, stong cheeses, and/or with dessert. \r\n\r\nMonk Madness Ale is brewed with 12 ingredients: 2-row Pale, Belgian Munich, Belgian Special B, Weyermann Melonodon, and Amber Malts; Belgian Nobles, Chinook, Amarillo, Centennial, and Summit Hops; along with free-range coastal water and Rogues proproetary PacMan Yeast. Available in 22 ounce bottles and kegs. Note, Monk Madness was not brewed in the winter of 2007-2008 due to shortages of the speciality malts.","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
