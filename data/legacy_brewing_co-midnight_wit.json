The texture is silky, creamy, and refreshingly delightful. Brewed with European Pilsner malt, unmalted wheat, a blend of 5 different spices and then fermented with a classic Belgian yeast strain. Our Brewmaster learned the art of brewing tantalizing and award-winning white beers during his time in Belgium and this beer shows it.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
