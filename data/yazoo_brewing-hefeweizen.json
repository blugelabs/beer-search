This beer is made with mostly wheat and uses a true Hefeweizen yeast that gives it a fruity, banana aroma with just a hint of cloves. The tart finish makes this the perfect summer beer.\r\n\r\nFood pairings: Almost anything goes well with Hefeweizen but it especially shines when paired with salads and omelets.\r\n\r\nOG: 12.0 Plato\r\nFG: 2.3 Plato\r\nIBUs: 13\r\nSRM: 3\r\n5.0% abv","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
