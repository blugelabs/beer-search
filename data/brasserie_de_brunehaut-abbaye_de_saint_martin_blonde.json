Slightly hazy golden color with a white head. Earthy clay, light molasses, and buttered cauliflower aromas. A crisp, frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of figs, creamy caramel, and roasted carrot flavors. This St. Martin Blonde ale finishes with dried fruit and cashew fade.\r\nAbbye St. Martin Ales are pure Belgium.","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
