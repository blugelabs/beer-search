But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%.","style":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
