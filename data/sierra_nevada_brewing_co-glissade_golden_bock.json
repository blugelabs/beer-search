Glissade is a remarkably mellow take on the traditional spring bock. With restrained sweetness, we emphasize subtle malt flavor, balanced against delicate aromas of spicy and floral European hops. This complex balance helps Glissade slide across the palateâ€”bracing us against the last cold nights of winter, while its bright golden color turns our thoughts toward spring.","style":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","category":"German Lager"}
