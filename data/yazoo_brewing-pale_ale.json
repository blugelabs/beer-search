Our Yazoo Pale Ale bursts with spicy, citrusy hop aroma and flavor, coming from the newly discovered Amarillo hop. The wonderful hop aroma is balanced nicely with a toasty malt body, ending with a cleansing hop finish. Made with English Pale, Munich, Vienna, and Crystal malts, and generously hopped with Amarillo, Perle, and Cascade hops. Fermented with our English ale yeast.","style":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
