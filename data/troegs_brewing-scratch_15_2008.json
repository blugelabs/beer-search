We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a Double Espresso Oatmeal Stout.\r\n\r\nThe double in the name refers to the espresso (not the alcohol). Scratch #15â€™s espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.\r\n\r\nChocolate, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness. The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans.","style":"Oatmeal Stout","category":"British Ale"}
