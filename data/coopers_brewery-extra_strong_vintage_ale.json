This strong ale imparts rich full flavours that are suitable for maturation. Brewed with choice malts and an extended top fermentation, Coopers Extra Strong Vintage Ale will improve with age, becoming more interesting and complex in flavour for up to 18 months. The results are well worth the wait!"}
