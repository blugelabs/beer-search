Guilded goblets brimming with seasonal brews were lifted to lips, speaking a language no longer known. \r\nCenturies pass.\r\n\r\nThe winter wind finds its way through heavy wood doors. There is a solemn business of monks to be done. But also brewing, a season of celebration is about to begin....\r\nMore years pass.\r\nThe modern age. \r\nThe present connects the past through the brewer's art and a new beer is born.\r\nFeast of Fools... \r\nA perfect dessert beer brewed exclusively for the holiday season.  Hand bottled, champagne corked. \r\nOur inky, rich, black stout, with the addition of raspberries.","style":"Fruit Beer","category":"Other Style"}
