The sweetness of the ale and crystal malts blend beautifully with the assertive flavors of Cascade and Mt. Hood hops. A brew to be savored.\r\n\r\nThis beer originated as a prize-winning homebrew many years ago. When Darron, the Head Brewer, began designing the beers for the Pelican Pub and Brewery, he adapted his old 5 gallon homebrew recipe to his new 15 bbl (465 gallon) brewery. It was well worth the effort, for not only has the Doryman's Dark Ale been a perennial favorite here at the Pelican Pub, but it has garnered prestigious professional awards.","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
