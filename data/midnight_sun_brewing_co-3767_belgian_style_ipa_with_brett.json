{"name":"3767 Belgian-style IPA with Brett","abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"midnight_sun_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"The extensive distance between two breweries on the West Coast – 3767 miles – is bridged by this collaboration beer. Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. \r\n\r\nJust prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. \r\nThe plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Here’s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
