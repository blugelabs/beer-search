[How's that for a catchy term that those BiG brewers can't TouCH. I love it, LoVe it, LOVE it.] The first batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged, and transferred to the kettle. The second batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged and transferred to the kettle using the sweet wort from batch one as its mash \"water\". Hmmm...using \"beer\" to make beer. Hence the name FREE LOADER. This Double Red IPA is just that--big, red, hoppy.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
