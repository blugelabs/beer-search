With over 12 years brewing experience under his belt, founding the brewery operations at Long Valley Pub & Brewery in New Jersey and resurrecting Time Square Brewery in Manhatten, Brewer Tim brings a good sense of what beers people enjoy drinking to Elk Creek Aleworks.  Winning Gold and Bronze medals for his Porter and Bitter at the prestigous Great American Beer Festival attests to the fact that his peers also think he makes great beer. Drawing inspiration primarily from traditional English ale brewing, Tim makes balanced beers, giving both malt and hops prominence in every pint.  In addition to our rotating selection of seasonal brews, we offer six outstanding House Standards year 'round.  Without doubt, there's a pint for you!","address":["100 West Main Street PO Box 432"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":40.8911,"lon":-77.477}}
