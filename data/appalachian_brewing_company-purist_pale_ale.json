Many American micros have developed their own version of this classic English style beer. Our brewers anticipate that you will enjoy their variation. \r\nHikers on the Appalachian Trail are considered \"purist hikers\" if they cover every inch of the trail during the hike. Our brewers refuse to compromise the quality of our products with the \"purist hiker\" in mind.","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
