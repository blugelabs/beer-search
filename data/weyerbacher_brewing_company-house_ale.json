Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale, Caramunich, and Carapils malt for flavor and body, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops, a very delicate, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania, in our Variety Pack Case.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
