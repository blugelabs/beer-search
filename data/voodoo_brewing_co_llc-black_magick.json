We then gently age that beer in Elaigh Craig 13 1/2 year old Bourbon Barrels for 1 yr. and then primed and bottled to bottle condition for continued aging and celler life. Black Magick should be able to be aged up to about 5 years, to heighten the complexity and smooth nature of this beer. This beer should be opened to breath, pour into snifter and enjoy at 55-60 F. \r\n\r\nThis is a truly Barrel aged ale and is not to have a large carbonation. We bottle condition it to achieve cask like characteristics.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
