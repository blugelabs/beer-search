The name of this beer style comes from the German word \"alt\" meaning \"old\". This refers to the aging that alts undergo since they ferment more slowly and at colder temperatures than most ales. Slow fermentation helps condition the flavors in Alaskan Amber, contributing to its overall balance and smoothness.\r\n\r\nRichly malty and long on the palate, with just enough hop backing to make this beautiful amber colored \"alt\" style beer notably well balanced.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Amber is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row pale and specialty malts.  Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.","style":"Old Ale","category":"British Ale"}
