Bohemia and the Porcupine Mountains ski areas for three days of back country touring, lift served high speed runs, chili cook offs, and dancing and beer drinking to Finnish Reggae, Bluegrass, or whatever else comes out of the woodwork. Steve brews this hoppy American Brown Ale in honor of his good friends and ski buddies from all over the Midwest and Canada who attend. Rich, malty, and dry-hopped to perfection. Available December through March.","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
