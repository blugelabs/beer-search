The bottom-fermented \"Doppelbock\" beer combines the finest hops and dark barley malt. The Paulaner monks used to drink Salvator as a food substitute during Lent. The most famous master brewer was Frater Barnabas, who took over the Paulaner monastery brewery in 1773. His original recipe remains practically unchanged to this day. In order to preserve the original, Paulaner registered the name \"Salvator\" with the patent office in 1896.\r\n\r\nSalvator:\r\n18.3% original wort; 7.9% alcohol; 70.6 kcal/100 ml","style":"German-Style Doppelbock","category":"German Lager"}
