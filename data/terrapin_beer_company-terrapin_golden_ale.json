We are known for using a ton of flavorful ingredients and for pushing the envelope with the brews we create.\r\n\r\nWe have also been known to take pleasure in hiking, biking, kayaking, and just plain having fun in the great outdoors. When we get hot and sweaty even hopheads like us want nothing more than to enjoy a beer that is crisp and refreshing.\r\n\r\nWhich is why we created the perfect session beer â€“ the Terrapin Golden Ale.","style":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","category":"Other Style"}
