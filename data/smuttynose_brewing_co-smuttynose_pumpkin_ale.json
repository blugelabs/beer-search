Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and “pompions.”\r\n\r\nIn that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original.","style":"Pumpkin Beer","category":"Other Style"}
