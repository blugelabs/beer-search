{"name":"Hoppe Imperial Extra Pale Ale","abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"southern_tier_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"The simplicity of Hoppe tests the skill and ability of the brewer to create something truly majestic. We craft this much like a sculptor who uses only a hammer and chisel to shape stone into a masterpiece. Hoppe is spawned of these few essentials: barley, wheat, hops, yeast and water. This limited palette is an exercise in minimalism, with refined elements which are deliberately selected. This simple combination creates a golden shimmering brew infused with delicate aromas. The artful nature of this beer is exposed with the first taste. As the malt and hops create a composition of flavors, an elegant finish leaves an impression that your tastes will not soon forget.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
