Samuel Adams® Hefeweizen beer is a traditional spin on a classic American craft brewing style. The brewers of Samuel Adams® used both malted and unmalted wheat, and two row Pale barley for a clean malty, cereal note. This bright, fruity wheat ale is unfiltered, retaining a natural haze from malt proteins, crisp, bright flavors of wheat, and fresh, fruity ester complexity from our proprietary ale yeast. Accentuated with Noble Spalt-Spalter hops, Samuel Adams® Hefeweizen has an elegant and pleasant bitterness, finishing smooth and clean.","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","category":"German Ale"}
