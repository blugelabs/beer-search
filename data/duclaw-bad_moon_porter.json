{"name":"Bad Moon Porter","abv":5.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"duclaw","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"A complex, robust porter, Bad Moon is medium to full bodied with a slightly sweet, malty presence combined with hints of chocolate and coffee. This is a full-bodied beer that gets its chocolate and coffee-like flavors and color from the use of generous amounts of roasted malts. It has a smooth finish and a balanced hop character.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
