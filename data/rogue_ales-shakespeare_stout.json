Later, the stronger Imperial and Double Stouts emerged. Sweet, Milk, and Oatmeal Stouts are English adaptations with less alcohol and less bitter then the dry Irish Stouts. Victorian England recognized Oatmeal Stouts nutritional value and it is traditionally the drink of choice for nursing mothers and athletes. It is a beer equally at home with oysters as it is with a homemade pizza and freshly tossed green salad (or as a float over ice cream).\r\n\r\nRogues Shakespeare Stout received a 99, the highest score of the 309 beers in 44 categories at the 1994 World Beer Championships. The June/July 1998 issue of Mens Journal included Rogue Ales Shakespeare Stout as one of \"The 100 Best Things to Eat in America.\"Based on Stuart Kallens book, \"The 50 Best Beers in the World\", Shakespeare Stout was ranked the third best beer in the world and best American Beer--which makes it the Worlds Best Stout!\r\n\r\nRogues Shakespeare Stout is ebony in color, a rich creamy head and a mellow chocolate aftertaste. It is made from Northwest Harrington, Crystal, and Chocolate malts, roasted barley and rolled oats, along with Cascade hop.
