Rockslide IPA is brewed in the 'West Coast' style with aggressive amounts of American hops such as Amarillo, Centennial and Summit hops. You are greeted with a full frontal assault of citrus/grapefruit/pine hop character, followed up with malt to balance the mouthfeel. This beer is all about hops.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
