They called this Dead Reckoning.  We see our beer the same way.  We know where to begin and know where to go, but there are hundreds of ways to get there.\r\n\r\nDead Reckoning is unfiltered and weighs in at 5.8% abv and 53 IBU’s. It features Pilsner, Caramel, Chocolate and Roasted malts along with Chinook and Vanguard hops. “The outstanding taste and flavor of Dead Reckoning originates in the chocolate and roasted malts,” says John Trogner. \"There is a nice hoppiness in the front of the beer, but the rich, smooth mouth feel is what really stands out.\"","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
