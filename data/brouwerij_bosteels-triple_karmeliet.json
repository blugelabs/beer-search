These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\nVery refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nTripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine\r\ndryness.","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
