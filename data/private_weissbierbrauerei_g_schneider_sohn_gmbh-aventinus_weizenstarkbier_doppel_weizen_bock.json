{"name":"Aventinus Weizenstarkbier / Doppel Weizen Bock","abv":8.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"private_weissbierbrauerei_g_schneider_sohn_gmbh","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Dark-ruby, almost black-colored and streaked with fine top-fermenting yeast, this beer has a compact and persistent head. This is a very intense wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like arome with a hint of banana and raisins. On the palate, you experience a soft touch and on the tongue it is very rich and complex, though fresh with a hint of caramel. It finishes in a rich soft and lightly bitter impression.","style":"South German-Style Weizenbock","category":"German Ale"}
