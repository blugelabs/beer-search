{"name":"Lion Brewery Inc.","city":"Wilkes Barre","state":"Pennsylvania","code":"18705","country":"United States","phone":"(800) 233-8327","website":"http://www.lionbrewery.com/","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"With a proud brewing heritage dating back to 1905, The Lion Brewery merges rustic architecture with state-of-the-art brewing technology, a contrast typified by the gleaming stainless steel aging tanks that sit alongside the traditional copper brew kettle. Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.","address":["700 North Pennsylvania Blvd."],"geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":41.2557,"lon":-75.8583}}
