{"name":"Barrel-Aged Blind Date Ale","abv":7.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"four_peaks_brewing","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"This is the old tried and true Blind Date Ale of old. It is based on an English Olde Ale but has an addition of 300 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool dates. The dates contribute a complexity and sweetness that the malt alone cannot. This Blind Date has been aged for three months in Jim Beam oak bourbon barrels. The oak and bourbon lend flavors of vanilla, wood, and of course, bourbon. These flavors layered with the dates created a big, multi-leveled ale. The alcohol content is about 7.5% alc/vol. You'll have to get to Four Peaks quick since we only have a few kegs of this unique beer.","style":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
