Imperial Chocolate Stout is named for the delicious sound made as large amounts of Wilbur chocolate and west coast hops are added directly into the simmering brew kettle. This hefty black imperial-style stout boasts a rich caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your two front teeth into. The bold flavors found in Kerplunk! are produced using a generous blend of roasted barley, crystal malts and locally produced chocolate. The resulting brew exhibits a deliciously complex and unique profile of subtle mocha coffee and intense chocolate, balanced nicely by the underlying roasted hop bitterness. This is a balanced strong brew boasting an A.B.V. of 8.1% that can creep up on you."}
