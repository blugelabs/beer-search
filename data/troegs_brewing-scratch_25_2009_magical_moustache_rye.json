{"name":"Scratch #25 2009 Magical Moustache Rye","abv":6.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"troegs_brewing","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"This mahogany ale packs a lingering, earthy hoppiness. The addition of more than 20% rye to the grain bill gives a creamy mouthfeel and hints of spice that compliment the bitterness of hops. Subtle fruitiness come through from the Bravo hops added during the boil, but the Cluster and Liberty varieties used in dry-hopping this beer are the true flavor drivers in this spicy ale. Dark in color and intense is flavor, Scratch 25-2009 finds true balance in a beer that could have easily gone way over the top. Enjoy.","style":"American Rye Ale or Lager","category":"Other Style"}
