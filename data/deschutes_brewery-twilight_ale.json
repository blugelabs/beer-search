There is something magical about the time of day that falls between light and dark, the high-desert summer day fading into a warm evening with brilliant skies.\r\n\r\nTwilight Ale is a lighter, but full flavored ale with a balanced malt profile and a harmonious blend of four hops.  A final dry hopping of bold Amarillos creates the distinctive finishing touch.  Twilight is best enjoyed when chilled and consumed outdoors.","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
