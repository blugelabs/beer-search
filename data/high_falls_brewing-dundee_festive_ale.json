Your brother in-law snoring on the air mattress? (Boy, let’s hope that’s snoring.) The variety of toys with realistic sound effects? Fruit cake?\r\n\r\nDundee Festive Ale may be one of the few exceptions. One sip of the carefully matched seasonal spices and you realize that the holidays are worth paying...waiting for.\r\n\r\nOh, there may be one other thing to be festive about. There’s a 13 to 1 chance against your brother in-law’s plane leaving on time. But at least there’s a chance.\r\n\r\nFestively hearty and full bodied with a mild nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange peel spice character and subtle crystal malt flavor.","style":"Winter Warmer","category":"Other Style"}
