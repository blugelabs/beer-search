This ale is feisty and a bit hoppy.  There is a malty sweetness and a somewhat dry finish.  Traditional East Kent Goldings but with a nice touch of Cascade and dash of roasted barley give this ale a great taste. ALWAYS AVAILABLE...or at least we try.","style":"Irish-Style Red Ale","category":"Irish Ale"}
