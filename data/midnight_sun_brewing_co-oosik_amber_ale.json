Deep amber with copper highlights, Oosik sports a toasted and caramel malt profile, balanced by traditional noble hops. A special yeast strain ferments this ale at cooler lager temperatures, giving it a smooth malt character and a clean finish. \r\n\r\nWant to hang—so to speak—for a while? Oosik Amber Ale gives you hang time. Great flavor, big mouthfeel, satisfying finish…all in a session-worthy beer. Compare it to other ambers—Oosik rules.
