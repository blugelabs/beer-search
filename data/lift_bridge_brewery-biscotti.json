By utilizing an array of malts, oats, wheat, pure local honey, light European hops and delicately spicing with Grains of Paradise, Madagascar vanilla beans, whole star anise, all brought together with traditional Belgian yeast, the result is a cloudy, deep copper colored, complex experience. This delight to the senses should be served in a 12 ounce footed glass and allowed to warm to 50 degrees to fully gather the malt and spice spectrum.","style":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
