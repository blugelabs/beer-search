{"name":"Weldspatter IPA","abv":7.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"bavarian_barbarian_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Weldspatter IPA is not your typical India Pale Ale. First of all, it isn’t as aggressively hopped as many other American versions. Second, it isn’t quite as pale. Balance is a lovely thing in beers and Weldspatter IPA achieves balance without compromising hop presence. The hop flavor and aroma abound, but the bitterness is held in check to give our IPA a pleasant malt character as well.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
