{"name":"Jasparilla","abv":9.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"independence_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Brilliantly golden, Jasperilla is a unique take on an old ale. Biscuity malt flavors meld with subtle plum and berry notes, produced by a special blend of English Old Ale and Chico yeasts. Brewed once a year, and aged for six months prior to release, the Jasperilla is smooth despite its 9% abv.\r\nJasper dressed as Hosehead from Strange Brew\r\n\r\nWe named this beer after our dog Jasper because he has brought so much joy to our lives. We got Jasper from a local dog rescue group called Mixed Breed Rescue. He has been a constant source of smiles and kept our spirits high through many late nights and long hours at the brewery.\r\n\r\nJasperilla is so good and smooth that you'll beg like a dog for more, roll over for a belly rub, howl at the moon...you get the picture.","style":"Old Ale","category":"British Ale"}
