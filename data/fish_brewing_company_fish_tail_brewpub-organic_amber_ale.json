Its organic pale, Munich, and crystal malts create a gentle sweet character that is difficult to resist.  From organic Hallertauer hops come a zesty flavor and aroma that beautifully balance Organic Amber's malt profile. The result: Truly delicious ale that salutes organic farmers and all the goodness they bring to our tables.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
