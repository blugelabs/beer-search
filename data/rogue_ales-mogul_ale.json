{"name":"Mogul Ale","abv":6.25,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"rogue_ales","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Mogul is a complex blend of 5 malts and 7 hops. This years Mogul (12/05) will only get better with time...its a hedonistic mouthful with layers of rich malt and tremendous bitterness. A quote from John \"more hops\" Maier, \"Keep Warm, Drink Mogul ~ Prost!\" This batch of Mogul was brewed with Pale, Munich, Dark caramunich, Melanoidin, and Amber malts. \r\nMoguls hops include Newport, Amarillo, Chinook, Horizon, Cascade, Centennial and Crystal...and Mogul (12/05) is dry-hopped with Amarillo and Centennial at the rate of 1 pound per barrel! Oh Hoppy Day!"}
