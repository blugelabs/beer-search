Yuengling has produced a Bock Beer in its long and storied past, and we have now reinvented that product for limited release in 2009. The new brew is dark brown in color and offers exceptional flavor that lives up to the quality Yuengling drinkers have grown to expect.\r\n\r\nYuengling Bock Beer will be offered in ½ barrels only, beginning in late February and lasting for approximately 8-10 weeks. Let’s all raise a pint of Yuengling Bock and celebrate the 180th Anniversary year!","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","category":"German Lager"}
