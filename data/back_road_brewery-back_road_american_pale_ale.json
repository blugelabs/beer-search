Straw colored from plump North American 2-row malted barley and deliciously hopped with Cascades from the USA, any patriot can enjoy this beer.  Cascade hops have a pleasant taste and fresh smell best described as florally or mildly citrusy.  A nice balance is struck between the malt and hops.  So how about it Yank?  Put that capitalism to work and buy some today!","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
