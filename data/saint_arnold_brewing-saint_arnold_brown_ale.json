It has a full, malty body with hints of chocolate, a touch of sweetness and a light hop flavor. A complex malt character is created by combining five different types of malts. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain. \r\n\r\nSaint Arnold Brown Ale is best consumed at 45-50Â° Fahrenheit.","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
