An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this country’s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captain’s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.","style":"Belgian-Style Tripel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
