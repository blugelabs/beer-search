Bocks are traditionally brewed in the winter / early spring months and are served during the spring / early summer months. The Helles Bock has a copper golden color with a brilliant white head. The body showcases a clean sweet maltiness that is offset by just enough hops to balance it. Very smooth and easy, drinkable yet deceptive at 6.4%.\r\n\r\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.","style":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","category":"German Lager"}
