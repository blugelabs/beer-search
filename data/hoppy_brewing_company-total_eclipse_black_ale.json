Characterized by its distinctive hop aroma and rich, black color, Total Eclipse redefines the way you think about a dark ale. Brewed at a low temperature to create a refreshingly dry finish, Total Eclipse uses only the finest two row malted barley and hops grown in the great Pacific Northwest. This combination results in a clean, crisp, hand-crafted experience. Hoppy Brewing Company has never used any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors in any of its ales. The Hoppy label is your guarantee of purity. \r\nIt’s “totally” out of this world delicious!!!","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
