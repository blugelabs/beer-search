More assertively hopped than ordinary bitters, light copper-colored HotShot showcases clean hop flavors, balanced by its slightly fruity nose and light-caramel malt character.\r\n\r\nWhile HotShot is one of Great Divideâ€™s easiest-drinking and lower alcohol beers, its complex flavor profile makes it the perfect session beer for craft beer lovers.","style":"Extra Special Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
