This classic-style Abbey beer features an immense head with a fruity nose and a generous body. Malty in the middle, the beer features a clean, almondy dry finish and a slight alcohol warmth. More like a wine than a beerâ€”it has a lot of the qualities of a fine Burgundy.\r\n\r\nBeer writer Michael Jackson has praised the Flying Fish Dubbel as \"a wonderful example of the style.\"","style":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
