This malty characteristic and crisp dryness is derived from malts of the roasted chocolate malt style. The hop character is medium to allow the chocolate malts to show through.\r\n\r\nMonteith’s brewers have been able to develop traditional ale fermentation characters while allowing the interesting roasted malt notes to come through in the aroma.","style":"Irish-Style Red Ale","category":"Irish Ale"}
