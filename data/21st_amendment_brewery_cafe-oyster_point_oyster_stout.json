Chocolate milk color head, providing an array of Belgian lace. Toffee and light roasty aromas and flavors. A malty sweet taste is evident but, this rich oatmeal based stout finishes dry. Made with 20 lbs. of oysters, in the boil, from our good friends at Hog Island Oyster Company.","style":"American-Style Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
