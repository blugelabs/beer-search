{"name":"Pompier","abv":12.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"pennichuck_brewing_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Our fourth in the Firehouse Ales Series, Pompier means \"fireman\" in French and represents our continued commitment to celebrate and honor the men and women who respond to the call day after day.  Pompier is rich and  smooth with complexities that come from a huge grain bill comprised of premium imported specialty malts, French Strisselspalt aroma hops and a 3 month aging process in oak hogsheads where it is combined with toasted French oak wood chips and champagne yeast.  Pompier is intended to be a vintage quality English-Style Barleywine with a French twist.  Appreciate its fine character and 12.1%ABV when we release this single 10 barrel batch sometime in December or you may choose to cellar it for many years to come.  \r\n\r\nYou will find Pompier on retail shelves packaged in the same 1 Liter Swing-Top bottle that has become a signature for our specialty beers."}
