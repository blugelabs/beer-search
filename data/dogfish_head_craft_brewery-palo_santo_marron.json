The caramel and vanilla complexity unique to this beer comes from the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood from which these tanks were crafted. Palo Santo means \"holy tree\" and it's wood has been used in South American wine-making communities. \r\n\r\nThis beer is a 12% abv, highly roasty, and malty brown ale aged on the Palo Santo wood.  It was a huge hit at our Rehoboth Beach brewpub when first released in November of 2006, so it's coming back... into full production!\r\n\r\n At 10,000 gallons each, these are the largest wooden brewing vessels built in America since before Prohibition.\r\n\r\nClick below to watch \"Take Time,\" the short film we released with the first full-production batch of Palo Santo Marron in February 2008.\r\n\r\nIt's all very exciting. We have wood. Now you do too.","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
