Much like its namesake, this imperial IPA is regal, intense and mighty. With hops and malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant and pungent along with an insane amount of malted barley - fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence.\r\n\r\nThis newest Avery Dictator completes the \"Dictator Series\" joining the likes of The Kaiser & The Czar. Be aware that The Maharaja is a limited release only available for the summer. Welcome to his kingdom!\r\n\r\nAvailability:\r\n    * 22 oz. bottles\r\n    * 5.17 gallon keg\r\n    * 15.5 gallon keg\r\n    * Available March through August\r\n\r\nABV:\r\n    * 10.5% (2008)\r\n    * 9.78% (2007)","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
