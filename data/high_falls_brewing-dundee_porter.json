And nowhere is that more evident than in our beer—puny liquids without calories, carbs, or cojones. \r\n\r\nBut it needn’t be that way, my friend! Sure, we don’t want to make a living shoveling coal or washing clothes on a rock. But we can recapture the more robust spirit of a time gone by.\r\n\r\nDundee Porter is a throwback to a different era—when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good life—even though they only saw it from a distance. \r\n\r\nWith Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.\r\n\r\nBig and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
