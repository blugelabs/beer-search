It is an aromatic dark beer with 6.5% alcohol content.\r\n\r\nIn the marl pits in Kanne ( Belgium) and Valkenburg (the Netherlands), deep under the ground, you can taste the Grottenbier in a constant temperature of 11° Celsius.\r\n\r\nAs it is the case with Champagne, the bottles are placed in a “pupitre” with results in an additional fermentation. \r\n\r\nThis beer with a high fermentation with a second fermentation in the bottle has been pointed out as one of the best 10 present-day beers by beer guru Michael Jackson.","style":"Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
