The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness. The addition of flaked oats rounds out these sometimes harsh characteristics producing a velvet smooth ale. This black stout has a flavor profile unique to all of North America. Subtlety is not a strong point as it is a stout after all, rich and eminently drinkable. \r\n\r\nAlcohol content of approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)","style":"Oatmeal Stout","category":"British Ale"}
