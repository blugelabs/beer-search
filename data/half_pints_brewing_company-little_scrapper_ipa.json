{"name":"Little Scrapper IPA","abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"half_pints_brewing_company","updated":"2010-12-13 19:33:36","description":"To admit that the brewer at Half Pints is a bit of a hophead is an understatement. This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank. A firm toasted malt presence forms the background for all of these hops, and we're confident our Little Scrapper IPA could take other so-called IPA's to the mat if called upon to do so. Try it with a curry or a basket of beer battered fish & chips. Serve in a glass at 8 degrees celcius. Unpasturized.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
