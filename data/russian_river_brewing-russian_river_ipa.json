Not only do we use generous portions of hops in the kettle, but we also dry hop this ale for one week after fermentation. The dry hopping process adds to this beer's floral and citrus aroma. This is truly a tasty adult beverage!","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
