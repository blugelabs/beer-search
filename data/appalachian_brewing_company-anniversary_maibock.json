This malty lager is deep golden in color and medium in body. The finish holds a bold sweetness that is balanced by a subtle hop flavor and aroma. \r\n\r\nWe will be releasing this beer every spring in celebration of our Anniversary.","style":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","category":"German Lager"}
