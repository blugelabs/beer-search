The extra strength in alcohol and hops helped preserve the beer on its long export journeys to India and beyond. The style developed a following worldwide. Its flavor begins with a smooth, malty creaminess followed with a big burst of dry-hop flavor from English Kent Golding Hops. It then finishes with a lingering yet pleasant bitterness.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
