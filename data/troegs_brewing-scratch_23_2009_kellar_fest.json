This unfiltered lager features all German malts and noble hops. Fermented with the Augustinerbrau yeast strain, Kellar Fest is a blend of Bohemian Pils, Munich and Vienna malts. The Magnum hops provide a crisp bitterness and the Hallertau noble hops impart a slight earthy taste. Kellar Fest finishes crisp and dry with hints of fruit. Grab a lamb handle and savor this Kellar Fest."}
