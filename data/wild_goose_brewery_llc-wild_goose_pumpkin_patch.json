Pumpkin Patch pours a hazy orange with frothy, ivory colored head. The nose immediately conjures images of Grandma baking pumpkin pie with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. Medium body and mild carbonation yield a spicy, pumpkin flavor - from the 300 lbs. of pumpkin we use to brew this unique beer.","style":"Pumpkin Beer","category":"Other Style"}
