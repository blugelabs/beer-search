We the Brewers of Avery Brewing Company, in order to form a more perfect ale, require new leadership that can liberate us from our quagmires in foreign lands; embrace environmentally sound energy alternatives to imported oil; heal our ailing healthcare system; free us from tyrannical debt and resurrect the collapsing dollar. We hereby pledge to provide him with an ample amount of our Presidential Pale Ale to support in the struggle for the aforementioned goals! Hail to the New Chief!\" \r\n\r\nSo reads the label of Ale to the Chief, the latest limited release brew from Avery Brewing Company brewed to bid a fond farewell to our current Commander in Chief and welcome a new administration. Our thought process for this beer was rather simple: take the classic American Pale Ale, use American ingredients like West Coast Cascade hops and the American Ale yeast strain (a first for Avery Brewing) and produce a beer in the Avery tradition with intense, in-your-face flavor. This Presidential Pale Ale has a pungent nose of citrusy, green Cascade hops along with a medium body and a lingering bitter finish. Ale to the Chief! is a limited release brew, get some while it lasts!","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
