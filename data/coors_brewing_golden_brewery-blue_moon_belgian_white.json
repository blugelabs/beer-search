This type of ale is brewed with malt, wheat and oats. It is unfiltered, which allows protein and yeast to remain suspended in the beer and creates the cloudy appearance. This also adds to the smoothness and full body of the beer.\r\n\r\nPutting a new twist on the lime ritual, Blue Moon is traditionally served with a slice of orange.  Blue Moon was launched in 1995.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
