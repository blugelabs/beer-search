It started with Jim, Bill, Sara and Eleanor Carver. In 1986 Jim, Bill and Barb Wynne opened Carvers Bakery / Caf√© in Durango and the Winter Park Bakery was sold.   In 1988 Carvers opened the brewery  making it the first brewery in the four corners region since prohibition. Although still known affectionately by the locals as Carvers, Carvers then became Carver Brewing Company.  Since then Carvers has seen many exciting changes: opening it's outdoor Beer Garden in 1994 and undergoing dramatic remodels in the restaurant and on the patio in '98 and '02. In April of '07 it was deemed necessary to expand the brewery.  The brewery is now housed in the area previously occupied by the bakery.  After 20 years of serving Colorado's mountain folk, Carvers continues to provide the very best in food and beer.","address":["1022 Main Ave."],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":37.2748,"lon":-107.88}}
