The pour is slow and sluggish. Its head is menacing, becoming torn and tattered Belgian lace on the sides of the glass as you cautiously consume this brewâ€”sip by insidious sip. \r\n\r\nThe aroma is sweet from heavy malt and big alcohol with notes of vanilla, coconut and whiskey from the oak. The depth & breadth of roasted malt flavors loiters on the palate while the robust finish lingers, well, forever. \r\n\r\nSLOTH...Just add couch.","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","category":"North American Ale"}
