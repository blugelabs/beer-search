{"name":"Smoked Porter","abv":5.9,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"stone_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Stone Smoked Porter is dark, rich and complicated. A porter is substantially darker than a pale ale, but not as black or opaque as a stout. Our Smoked porter has a captivatingly deep mahogany color, complimented by silky dark tan head. Rich, full bodied and robust. Smooth, with chocolate and coffee-like flavors balanced by the subtle \"smoky\" character of just the right amount of peat-smoked specialty malt.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
