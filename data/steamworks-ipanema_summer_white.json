Known as Biere Blanche in French, Witbier in Flemish and White beer in English. Unmalted wheat and oats are used in the grist to lend this brew its smooth, light body. Coriander seed and Curacao orange peel are added to the kettle to infuse this beer with a subtle, perfumey spiciness. The result is a light wheat beer with a fruity, tart finish - the essence of summer.","style":"Belgian-Style White","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
