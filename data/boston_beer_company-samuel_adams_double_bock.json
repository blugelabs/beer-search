{"name":"Samuel Adams Double Bock","abv":8.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"boston_beer_company","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Intense and warming, a meal in a bottle.\r\nOne can not help but appreciate Samuel Adams® Double Bock's huge malt character. We use an enormous amount of malt, half a pound per bottle, to brew this intensely rich lager. Its deep brown-ruby color is all made in the kettle - no black malt is used, resulting in a rich sweetness that is free of the rough taste of burnt malt. All that remains is the velvet smooth flavor and mouthfeel of the two row malt. Samuel Adams® Double Bock's intense malt character is balanced with a subtle piney, citrus hop note from the German Noble hops.\r\n\r\nDue to legal restrictions, Samuel Adams® Double Bock can not be sold in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","category":"German Lager"}
