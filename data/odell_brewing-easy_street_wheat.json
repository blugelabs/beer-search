Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers \"taking it easy\" and not filtering the beer. However, for ultimate enjoyment, we encourage you to work just a little harder in pouring it: just pour 2/3 of the beer into a glass, swirl what's left to stir up the yeast, then pour the rest and enjoy.","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","category":"Other Style"}
