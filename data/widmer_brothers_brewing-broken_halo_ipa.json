The almost excessive amounts of Cascade and Columbus hops used in Broken Halo give it notable citrus and grapefruit aromas and flavors. The beer bitterness measures high but tastes smooth due to the full-bodied, Caramel malt sweetness. The finish is juicy, clean, and short lived. A devilishly bold, heavenly smooth India Pale Ale.\"\r\n-Widmer Brothers Brewing Company","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
