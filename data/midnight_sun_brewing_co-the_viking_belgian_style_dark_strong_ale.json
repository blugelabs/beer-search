Dark roasted malts, Belgian yeast, star anise and sweet-ripened raisins come together in an amazing ale that can be enjoyed now and cellared for later celebrations. \r\n\r\nAs you lock horns with this commemorative ale, toast to Yano. With his incredibly stoic spirit and his irrepressible laugh, Yano was the gentle giant who will forever touch our lives.
