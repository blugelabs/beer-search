That passion is reflected in the diversity of our offerings. We currently offer over twenty styles of beers. These range from our flagship beers Double Simcoe IPA, Hops Infusion, Merry Monks' Ale, Old Heathen and Blithering Idiot Barleywine to our big seasonals like QUAD and Imperial Pumpkin Ale. And don't forget our bourbon barrel beers: Heresy, Insanity, and Blasphemy ( and yes, we actually age them in real bourbon barrels, and we only use the barrels once). We practically have a new seasonal every month.","address":["905 Line Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":40.6732,"lon":-75.2249}}
