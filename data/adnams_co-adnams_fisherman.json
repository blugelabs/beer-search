If your local pub has the good sense to serve cask beer, look for Fisherman on draught from January through March.\r\n\r\nClean and refreshing yet dark and mysterious, Fisherman is a deep coppery red, conjuring roasted nuts and dark chocolate, with a lingering taste of liquorice and dried fruits.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
