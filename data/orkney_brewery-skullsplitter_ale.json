Sophisticated, satiny smooth with a deceptively light character, it is a tribute to our colourful forbear.\r\n\r\nOn the nose, this strong beer has a fruity malt character, with hints of dark fruit, spicy hop, dates and figs.\r\n\r\nOn the palate, rich and complex with sweet toasted malt, molasses, fresh and dried fruit and hints of warming spices.","style":"Scotch Ale","category":"British Ale"}
