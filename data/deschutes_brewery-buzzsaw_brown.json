The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. \r\n\r\nBuzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day’s work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.\r\n\r\n“Buzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,” says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. “The unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.”","style":"American-Style Brown Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
