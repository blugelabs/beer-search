Especially this beer. Manifesto is one of FiftyFifty's flagship beers. This beer is a delight for those who take pleasure in craft beers and are looking for something that they can enjoy a few pints of. Manifesto has a restrained malt backbone of flavor with mild biscuit and caramel notes, and the hop character is light to moderate with mild earthiness evolving to a slightly more moderate citrus/piney finish. This is a beer of principle.","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
