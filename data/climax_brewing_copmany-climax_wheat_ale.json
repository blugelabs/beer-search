Wheat Ales such as this typically have banana and clove flavors but as Dave dislikes clove, he used a special yeast to strengthen the banana flavors. Hefeweizen is a nice, light, crisp summer beer that can be served with lemon or flavored syrups.","style":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager","category":"Other Style"}
