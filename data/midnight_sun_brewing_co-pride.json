Plentiful pale malt creates beautiful, agile body. Assertive hops and Belgian yeast achieve charismatic floral and spice notes in aroma and flavor. But Pride’s predominant and unique character comes from its exposure to Brettanomyces in French oak Chardonnay barrels. At once tart and refreshing yet earthy and musty, Pride is unlike most beers on earth. And it’s bitter, lingering finish demands another sip. \r\n\r\nAwarded a BRONZE medal at World Beer Cup 2008, Pride has much too much to boast about.","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
