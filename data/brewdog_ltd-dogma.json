A conspiracy of transcontinental ingredients infused with some devastatingly BrewDog imaginative thinking.\r\n\r\nThe flavours, intricacies and nuances of this beer are best enjoyed while musing over some obscure 17th Century philosophical meanderings, such as:\r\n\r\n\"If we disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we will do much, what as wisely as he who would not use his wings but sit still and perish because he had no wings to fly.\"\r\nJohn Locke.\r\n\r\nThis beer is not cool. You may think it is, but that is just a beautiful lie fabricated by clowns and gypsies.","style":"Herb and Spice Beer","category":"Other Style"}
