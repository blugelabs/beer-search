LaPorte, Indiana is known as the \"Maple City\" because of its trees.  This German style Oktoberfest lager beer has a golden copper color and intense malty flavor.  We make this beer 4 times a year, but it is hard to find because it goes so fast.  Give it a try and you may find it worthy of the gold.... or at least another round","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","category":"German Lager"}
