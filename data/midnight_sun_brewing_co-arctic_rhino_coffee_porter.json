{"name":"Arctic Rhino Coffee Porter","abv":5.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"midnight_sun_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Inspired by local artist & roaster Michael Allen's eccentricly-named blend of coffee beans, Midnight Sun's brewers designed a beer recipe and infusion process that perfectly captures the alluring aroma, satisfying flavor and curious legend of Allen's Arctic Rhino Coffee. \r\n\r\nArctic Rhino Coffee Porter combines two quintessential Pacific Northwest favorites: coffee and ale. The result is wonderfully romantic and robust--a duel-fueled porter that melds charismatic dark malt with freshly roasted coffee beans. The (un)rest is up to you.","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
